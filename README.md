## Pooling Methods
### Non-learning based
* sum, mean, generalized mean
* max, n-max pooling, [recycled max ](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Chen_Why_Discard_if_You_Can_Recycle_A_Recycling_Max_Pooling_CVPR_2022_paper.html)
* covariance pooling
* [FSpool](https://github.com/Cyanogenoid/fspool)
* Janossy pooling
* SWE,WE

### Learning based (Attention based)
* PMA (Set Transformer)
* ...(working on it)
